## Hi there 👋 I'm Brie!
I'm an epidemiology student hoping to switch to biostats. I'll be using this github to host an abridged version of my CV and upload my projects. I hope to combine my love of statistics, data, and coding with my interest in public health to further human welfare.

### 🔍 Primary Research Interests
- Statistical epidemiology.
- Mathematical modelling.
- Applications in psychiatry (especially in regards to bipolar disorder, PTSD, & suicide), reproduction & maternal health, and infectious diseases.
- One Health.

## Relevant Stuff from Prior to 2025
### 🏫 Undergraduate Education
*BA in Science Communications* from The College of William and Mary, 2019.
- A self-designed major focusing on a blend of nonfiction writing courses and earth/environmental science courses. (I was intending to go into science journalism)

*AS in Mathematics* from Northern Virginia Community College, 2016.
- Graduated Summa Cum Laude.

### 💼 Projects
*Data Analysis* for The Reading & Writing Center, Northern Virginia Community College, 2016
- Analyzed data to determine the effectiveness of the Reading and Writing Center’s program in which English tutors would go to remedial-level composition classes and assist students in the classroom environment.

*Modelling a Solar Dynamo Wave*, Northern Virginia Community College, 2016
- Used Maxwell’s Equations to derive an induction equation for an αω dynamo. Then split the equation into toroidal and poloidal equations, then expanded and simplified both equations using basic algebra and the determinant method for cross products. 
- Created and gave a presentation on my work at the 2016 college-wide STEM fair and won 2nd place in the oral presentations category.

### 🏆 Awards and Honors
- [NASA Community College Aerospace Scholar](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/internships/apply/nasa-community-college-aerospace-scholars/), 2016.
- 2nd place in Oral Presentation at STEM Fair 2016 for presentation on modelling a solar dynamo wave.
- Academic Achievement Award in History, 2016 (nominated by Professor Thomas Rushford, who said I was in the “top 1%” of students he has taught). One of 4 students who earned this award.
- Academic Achievement Award in Mathematics, 2016 (nominated by Professor Aeyung Jang). One of 14 students who earned this award.
- 4th place in the Third Annual NOVA Mathematics Competition, 2015.

### 👑 Leadership
*Honors Club President* at Northern Virginia Comunity College's Annandale Campus, 2015-2016
